#Porygon

A Discord bot to help with competitive Pokémon

Created by @mostly fireproof#2095

Commands:
poke - gives information on a specific Pokémon, needs to be finished
move - to be implemented
everything else - to be implemented

Lots of code from here:
Commando sample code
https://github.com/discordjs/Commando/tree/master/test
More Commando stuff
https://discordjs.guide/
Data from Pokémon Showdown
https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown/blob/master/data/

I probably need to change how statusesRaw.js is handled, as I don't need all
of the data it contains
